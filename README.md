## INSTALLATION

You can get the project by unzipping the .zip file uploaded.

If you are a developer of the project, you can also access it by cloning the project from Github with the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/LennardEc/Directed-Graph-Editor.git
```

After that you can install the required dependencies with [pip](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_pip.asp) if you have [Python] (https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
If you do not have [Python] (https://www.python.org/downloads/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

The recommended way of running the project is through a virtual environment. You can create one with [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) if you have it installed. If this is not the case you can install it with the following command:

```
pip install virtualenv
```

After this you can create the virtual environment with the following command:

```
virtualenv <env_name>
```

After this, you can activate the environment. On Windows you can use:

```
./<env-name>/Scripts/activate.bat
```

On MacOs and Linux:

```
source <env_name>/bin/activate
```

If it was successful your terminal will indicate this with the (`<env_name>`) sign.

You can find all the dependecies in the requirements section above or in the setup.py file. You can always check if an install was successful with the `pip freeze` command.

You can then install the project dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install <dependency-name>
```

## USAGE

After installing every dependency you should be able to access the application with the command:

```
python3 main.py
```

## DEVELOPMENT

- Open the Issues tab in the GitHub repository and grab an unassigned issue
- Assign it to yourself
- Change the status of the issue in the project from Todo to In progress
- Work on the issue
- If you want to add commit your changes please do the following:
  - checkout a new branch (please name your branch after the number of the issue and the name of ticket, for example 1-prepare-the-skeleton)
  ```
  git checkout -b <issuenumber-description>
  ```
  - add all your changes
  ```
  git add .
  ```
  - commit the changes (please name your branch after the number of the issue and a short description, for example "1 - prepared the project skeleton")
  ```
  git commit -m "ticket number - short description"
  ```
  - push your changes
  ```
  git push
  ```
- Open a new pull request on GitHub. As the reviewer please set up every developer in the current sprint.
- Please wait until you get at least one approved review.
- Merge the branches
- Delete the old branch
- Change the status of the issue in the project to Done
- Close the issue

## TESTING

Tests for testing file manager are under the `tests` directory

In order to run the tests you can run the following command in your favourite terminal:
